            As a Database Administrator with a solid background in database management, I feel my understanding of technical and web-based technologies would benefit your company. I am constantly striving to grow within my career, and working for such a prestigious company in the area would be a great opportunity to do just that.
            I hold a SAIT Database Administrator certificate and have obtained several database administrator certifications, including the Oracle Certified Professional (OCP), and CISCO networking basics certificate. My experiences in these previous years have allowed me to gain extensive skills in technical aptitude and fundamental computer forensics. I feel that my abilities and accomplishments closely match what you're looking for in a candidate and will allow me to be a beneficial part of your company.
            Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter. I'd be happy to provide you with past projects and systems I've created or helped create to further allow you to assess my capabilities. I look forward to hearing from you soon to learn more about the job and schedule a time to speak further about why I'd make a good fit for this role.
            Sincerely,
            Rovi Peralta
